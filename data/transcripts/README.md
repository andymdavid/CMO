# Transcripts Directory

This directory is where you add your podcast transcripts for processing.

## How to Use

1. Add your transcript files here (any format: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`)
2. Run the TGS_CMO system: `python main.py`
3. Your transcripts remain **private** - they won't be committed to git

## Supported Formats

- `.txt` - Plain text transcripts
- `.md` - Markdown formatted transcripts  
- Any text-based format

## Privacy

All files you add here are automatically ignored by git, keeping your content private while allowing the system to process them locally.
