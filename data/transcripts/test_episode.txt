Pete: The biggest mistake SMEs make is trying to scale before they've optimized their margins. We use a 3-step framework I call the "Margin First Method":

Step 1: Process audit - identify the biggest inefficiencies in your current operations. Most businesses are hemorrhaging money in areas they don't even track.

Step 2: Selective automation - automate the highest-impact, lowest-risk processes first. Don't automate everything at once.

Step 3: Measure and optimize - track margin improvement for at least 90 days before considering any scaling initiatives.

Andy: Exactly. Most business advice tells you to "scale fast or die" but that's how you kill a profitable small business. We've seen it happen dozens of times.

Pete: I worked with a Melbourne manufacturer who followed this exact framework. They increased margins by 23% in 6 months without adding any new customers. They just eliminated waste in their production process and automated their inventory management.

Andy: The key insight here is that conventional wisdom says "revenue growth solves all problems" but that's enterprise thinking. For SMEs, margin optimization comes first, then sustainable growth.

Pete: Another contrarian take - most SMEs think they need expensive consultants to find inefficiencies. Wrong. You can do a basic process audit yourself in a weekend using a simple spreadsheet to track where time and money actually go.

Andy: We developed a simple framework for this: Track everything for one week, categorize by value-add vs. waste, then tackle the biggest waste categories first. It's not rocket science, but most business owners never do it.

Pete: The Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that 60% of small businesses fail within the first 3 years, but businesses that focus on margin optimization in their first year have an 85% survival rate. That's not a coincidence.

Andy: Here's the tactical implementation: Week 1 - track everything. Week 2 - categorize and identify top 3 waste areas. Week 3 - implement solutions for the biggest waste category. Week 4 - measure results. Repeat monthly.

Pete: One more thing - this framework works regardless of industry. We've applied it to service businesses, retail, manufacturing, even professional services. The principles are universal for SMEs.
