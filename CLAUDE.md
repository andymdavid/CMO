# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure

This is a workspace directory containing multiple projects:
- `Projects/TGS_CMO/` - Currently empty project directory

## Development Workflow

This repository currently contains no active codebase. When projects are added, this file should be updated with:
- Build and development commands specific to each project
- Architecture patterns and key design decisions
- Testing strategies and commands
- Project-specific development guidelines

## Notes

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the codebase evolves to include relevant development commands, architectural patterns, and project-specific guidance.
